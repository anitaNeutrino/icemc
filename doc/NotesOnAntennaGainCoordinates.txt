Oindree was the last person to touch this portion of the
code, based on the comments. Around line 740 of icemc.cc, all the
numbers relating to the vectorization of the signals are declared.

e_component is "E comp along polarization".
h_component is "H comp along polarization".
n_component is "normal comp along polarization".

e_component_kvector is "component of e-field along the rx e-plane".
h_component_kvector is "component of e-field along the rx h-plane".
n_component_kvector is "component of e-field along the normal".
^^^^ These are all doubles ^^^^ 

On line 735 of icemc.cc; n_eplane, n_hplane, and n_normal are
defined as std:vectors. 

	n_eplane is in the          z-hat direction
	n_hplane is in the negative y-hat direction
	n_normal is in the          x-hat direction

Based on the comments present in balloon.cc, around line 620,
the normal vector is the vector pointing out, along the boresight
of the antenna.

Further, ant_normal is a std:vector which is the direction of the
boresight, "Vector normal to the face of the antenna". ant_normal
doesn't seem to be used in anything that's related to the antenna
gain.

Program flow

icemc.cc ln ~730;  Variables declared.
icemc.cc ln ~2800; GetAntennaOrientaiton called in a loop over
                   layers and phi ('ifold').

In the GetAntennaOrientation call;
balloon.cc ln ~630; n_eplane/hplane/normal are rotated about the
                    y-axis to point the antenna's boresight down
                    towards the earth. 
                    
                    Then, based on the phi-sector location of the 
                    antenna on anita, the antenna is rotated about
                    the z-axis.
                    
                    Finally, the antenna, now having it's axis
                    rotated to be consistent with it's place on
                    anita, is rotated to account for pitch, roll,
                    yaw, etc. of the payload.
