# Pretty UHEN limits for ANITA

Original macro by Amy Conolly for plotting Ultra-High Energy Neutrino limits (and related quantities)

## Compile
```
make
```

## Run
```
./makelimitplot
```

## Output
- Currently, ```makeLimitPlot``` produces a bunch of ARA related pdfs.
- The output of interest for ANITAns is test_Sensitivity.pdf (perhaps this should be renamed).
