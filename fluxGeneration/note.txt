### DESCRIPTION
The scripts here use CRPropa3 to generate theoretical neutrino (and nucleon) fluxes. When run, the program generates neutrino flux output files (in ../fluxes) which can be used directly by icemc plotting macros (in ../limits).

The output files take the format:

simFlux_EZ_AY_NX_cW_sV_zU.dat

Z = energy exponent
Y = power law index
X = number of cosmic rays propagated
W = boolean for exponential cut-off
V = boolean for source evolution
U = source evolution redshift cap

***These flux generation scripts will _not_ work out of the box.***

***You will need a fully installed and running version of CRPropa3 (and all of its prerequisites). Confirm your installation is working before running these scripts.***

### PREREQUISITES
CRPropa3 (and its prerequisites)
python
>numpy
>pylab
swig
ROOT (to run macros) 6+ recommended (and its prerequisites)

### USAGE
The macros should be run from within your CRPropa3 build directory (not this directory) with python (not pyROOT).

For options and explanations of parameters: python simulatedNeutrinoFlux.py -h

To run: python simulatedNeutrinoFlux.py
