# icemc is a tool to simulate neutrino interactions in the ice

To compile icemc you only need a working ROOT installation and then do:
   $ make


To run icemc:
   $ ./icemc -i {inputFile} -o {outputDirectory} -r {runNumber} -n {numberOfNeutrinos} -t {triggerThreshold}

If parameters are not specified:
   - inputs from inputs.txt are used,
   - the output directory is output,
   - the run number is 0
   - number of neutrinos to generate as is input file
   - trigger threshold for full band as defined in anita.hh for that flight


To produce Anita-like output files, source the Anita tools (you will need the eventReaderRoot and libFttwrapper) and re-compile. The next time you run icemc the anita-like outputs will be produced automatically.



Notes to generate Anita-3 simulations:
 - If you want to generate anita-3 simulations with the impulse response and noise you should turn on the flags in the input file as by default they are off;
 - If you want to generate a pure thermal noise sample you should to turn on these flags:
   —— set signal to 0 to measure noise hits
   —— skip cuts on neutrinos that won’t reach the payload (this is just to have it running quicker as we 0’ed the signal anyway)
   —— minimum bias flag (so that everything gets saved)
